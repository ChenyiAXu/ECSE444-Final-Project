A CNN-based real-time Human Motion Detection (HMR) system with STM32 B-L475E-IOT01Ax kits The project was written in C language. It utilizes USB, STM32AI, UART, and I2C functionalities with low power operation as optimization. The L4 board was tied to the wrist of the user to imitate the watch. It is capable of classifying motions like stationery. walking, running, jumping, clapping, and swimming. Data sets for stationary, walking and running were downloaded from STM32 Cube AI GitHub Repository while data for jumping, clapping, and swimming were collected at a rate of 26Hz using I2C feature and saved into the csv file using USB feature. The lower power optimization was confirmed using a multimeter.
